# Syntax highlighting for the B language

The repository contains a source code for the Sublime Text package which implements syntax highlighting for the B programming language. This package does not claim to complete covering of all the syntax constructions existing in B language specification, moreover, it does not try to fit to any implementation of this language.

As additional it contains snippets for some kinds of blocks and statements.

## Installation

First of all you need to [install Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation), then find and choose `B Syntax Highlighting` from the `Package Control: Install Package` dropdown list in the Command Palette.


## Sublime Text version support

It's compatable only with Sublime Text 3 Build 3103 or later because of using the .sublime-syntax instead of the .tmLanguage type of files.
